                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it to make
                    a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including versions
                    of Lorem Ipsum.

                    Why do we use it?
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when looking at
                    its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                    letters, as
                    opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                    publishing
                    packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
                    'lorem ipsum'
                    will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
                    sometimes by
                    accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
