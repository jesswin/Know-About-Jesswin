        <p class="paragraphs">What is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
            including versions
            of Lorem Ipsum.

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
            when looking at
            its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
            letters, as
            opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
            publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
            'lorem ipsum'
            will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
            sometimes by
            accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).What is Lorem Ipsum?
